  A new approach to a real-time multi-class object detection algorithm is presented in this project. The proposed method aims to recognize and locate objects using a convolutional neural network (CNN) from an image by generating a 3D tensor of 2D Gaussian probabilistic model (GPM) for each class. The proposed CNN will predict a tensor in which each layer of tensor will represent a 2D GPM. The peaks of the GPM will identify the objectâ€™s location. The variance of each Gaussian along the x- and y-axis will reflect the height and width of the object. Using the appropriate threshold value, object location will be identified.

The following is the system diagram of the proposed approach. GPM is generated by training a CNN and from the GPM objects in the image is localized.

The ground truth GPM is generated using bivariate distribution where peak the of the Gaussian corresponds to the center of the object in the image, and the widths and the heights of the objects bounding box corresponding to the variance along the x- and y-axis.
