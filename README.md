<h4 align="center">A Real-time Multi-class Object Detection Algorithm!</h4>

A new approach of a real-time multi-class object detection algorithm is presented. Prior state-of-the-art methods on object detection divide an image into regions (e.g., Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks) and run an image classifier over each region, or grid cells (e.g., You Only Look Once) and predict for objects for each grid cell in a single evaluation. The proposed method aims to recognize and locate objects using a convolutional neural network (CNN) from an image by generating a 3D tensor of 2D Gaussian probabilistic model (GPM) for each class. The proposed CNN will predict a tensor in which each layer of tensor will represent a 2D GPM. The peaks of the GPM will identify the objectâ€™s location. The variance of each Gaussian along the x- and y-axis will reflect the height and width of the object. Using the appropriate threshold value, object location will be identified. The bounding box coordinates of the objects will be determined by detecting the contours of each Gaussian around its peak after the thresholding.
